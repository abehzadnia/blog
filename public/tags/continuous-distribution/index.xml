      <description>Weâ€™ll introduce the beta distribution by using an example:
ExampleDiamond Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare autosomal dominant bone marrow disease. Children with Diamond Blackfan anemia present with symptoms of extreme anemia during the first year of life.
Unfortunately, patients have an increased risk of other serious bone marrow malfunctions. Specifically, they are prone to developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), certain blood cancers such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and bone cancer (osteosarcoma).</description>

      <description>If a random variable is continuous, its probability distribution is called a continuous probability distribution.
Recap  P(X = x) is zero if our X is continuous Continuous probability distributions cannot be tabulated  It&amp;rsquo;s conceptually impossible: we would need to have an infinite number of rows and columns to account for every single P between 0-1, which is infinite. This is well demonstrated in the * Zeno&amp;rsquo;s Paradox *.</description>
