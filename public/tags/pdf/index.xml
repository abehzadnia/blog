      <description>&lt;p&gt;Probability function is the function of a random variable distribution, whose value provides the &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;relative likelihood&lt;/em&gt; of the value of the random variable in the sample.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>If a random variable is continuous, its probability distribution is called a continuous probability distribution.
Recap  P(X = x) is zero if our X is continuous Continuous probability distributions cannot be tabulated  It&amp;rsquo;s conceptually impossible: we would need to have an infinite number of rows and columns to account for every single P between 0-1, which is infinite. This is well demonstrated in the * Zeno&amp;rsquo;s Paradox *.</description>
