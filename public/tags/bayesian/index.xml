      <description>Elicitation is the process of turning an expert’s prior beliefs about one or more uncertain quantities into a probability distribution for those quantities. The term expert simply refers to somebody within the field in which the experiment/analysis is to take place. A successful elicitation process will lead to a prior distribution which accurately reflects the expert’s beliefs. An elicitation is accurate even if the expert’s prior judgements turn out to be completely incorrect!</description>

      <description>In order to have a better understanding of the difference between the frequentist approach and the Bayesian approach to interference let’s use the following example:
Efficacy of RU-486 as an emergency pillA randomized control trial was carried out to ask the question of whether Mifepristone (RU486) can be an effective morning after contraceptive. The study participants were 40 women who came to a health clinic asking for emergency contraception. Method: 20 women were randomly assigned to receive RU-486, and another 20 to receive standard therapy, consisting of high doses of estrogen and synthetic progesterone.</description>
