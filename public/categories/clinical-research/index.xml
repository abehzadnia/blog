      <description> A a good research question is targeted at a specific population. For example, “What is the risk of developing lung cancer among smokers?” specifies the population of interest - those who smoke.
Logistically, prospects of studying the population of interest is dim. Instead, a sample is taken as a reprasentative subset of the population.
Here we will look at a few sampling t
Randmised sample allows for generalisation

      <description>Clinical research is an essential part of practice of medicine. In short it is a project carried out by to investigate a research question - which should be focused on clinical aspect of medicine (i.e. the practice of medicine).
Structure of the research is heavily dependant on the subject of interest. However, almost all studies follow a logical and focused organisation. A study has to have:
 Research question(s)  Which needs to be FINER: feasible, interesting, novel, ethical and relevant  Background and significance  Put the question in context and provides rationale for the study  Design  Observation  Cohort studies: participants are divided into groups and are studied over a specified time frame  Time frame: prospective or retrospective  Cross sectional study Case control study  Experimental  Clinical trials Randomised blinded trials   Subjects  The population of interest Requires inclusion and exclusion criteria to define the population of interest Sampling: How the population will be sampled and how the participants would be recruited  Variables  Response variable(s): what will be studied - or more commonly - measured?</description>
