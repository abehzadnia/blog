      <description> A a good research question is targeted at a specific population. For example, “What is the risk of developing lung cancer among smokers?” specifies the population of interest - those who smoke.
Logistically, prospects of studying the population of interest is dim. Instead, a sample is taken as a reprasentative subset of the population.
Here we will look at a few sampling t
