If a random variable is continuous, its probability distribution is called a continuous probability distribution.

### Recap

- P(X = x) is **zero** if our X is continuous
- Continuous probability distributions **cannot** be tabulated
    - It's conceptually impossible: we would need to have an infinite number of rows and columns to account for every single *P* between 0-1, which is infinite. 
    - This is well demonstrated in the * **Zeno's Paradox** *. Read more about [Zeno of Elea's Paradox](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/)
- We use PDF to calculate the density function of a probability that lies between *a* and *b*.
