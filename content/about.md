# About me and this blog

Hey there, how's it going?

My name is Alrieza Behzadnia, I'm a fresh medical graduate interested in data science, statistical modelling and blogging about everything and anything.

The purpose of this website is to collate my revision notes and share them freely with anyone interested in statistical analyses. However, I aim to write about whatever interests me.

This is a Hugo static website; all statistical analyses are produced using R language. Site is rendered using R studio and Atom, published on GitHub and Netilfy.

Looking forward to hear from you :)
