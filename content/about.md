# About me and this blog

Hey there, how's it going?

My name is Alrieza Behzadnia, I'm a fresh medical graduate interested in statistical analysis and modelling. But most importantly I'm a datascientstiswannabe who pretends to know and/orGit init understand medical data.

## Background

I found the [rblogdown package on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/index.html) and instantly came to the conclusion that _I gots to have a blog!!!!_.

After going through the pain of learning Hugo and some SSC/HTML I built my first ambitious website. I called it Avic3nna -- thinking it was the cleaverest name I could come up with given that: I would focus on 1) statistical tools/analysis 2) Medically orientated posts (mainly re haematology) and 3) Philosophically orientated posts (mainly regarding propositional logic); and given that Avicenna was a Persian polymath interested in medicine, mathematics and philosophy I thought I'm a genius. Soon after the alpha release (i.e. uploading it without letting anyone else except me to access it) I realised I can't be the jack of all trades and maintaining a heavily graphical website - even if its static - is a BIG undertaking for a N00b like me.

Feeling like a l0sEr I built this static website that you see, keeping it plain and pretty. With the sole purpose of writing down R/statistics related stuff that I learn to be able to access them later with ease and to publicly share them with whoever is interested in this kinda stuff.

## Aim

I aim to write on statistics, medicine, philosophy and perhaps other stuff that I come across that I personally find interesting. It's gonna be a mixed bag - but its my mixed, _my preciousss_. : D

Looking forward to hear from you :)
